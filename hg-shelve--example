hg shelve looks equivalent to git stash. Basically, you can set aside changes that you're not actively working on. For example, at work I make changes that reduce warning messages, but it's not always easy to get code reviews on these changes. I could simply "shelve" these changes until they're up for discussion instead of keeping them un-tracked.
