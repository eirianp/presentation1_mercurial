One thing worth noting is that shelve is an extension. So, it may have to be installed. This isn't ideal, for instance if everyone is working in the same development environment and God says "you can't have this feature."

hg shelve looks equivalent to git stash. Basically, you can set aside changes that you're not actively working on. For example, at work I make changes that reduce warning messages, but it's not always easy to get code reviews on these changes. I could simply "shelve" these changes until they're up for discussion instead of keeping them un-tracked.
